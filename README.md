# SVIRO-Car-Occupancy-Recognition-ADAS

## Introduction
This project was developed as part of a university exam. The goal was to create a new Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) or address limitations in existing ones. Our idea focuses on increasing children's safety as car passengers by training a neural network capable of identifying the occupants of the front and rear seats in a car. This allows the system to activate the appropriate safety measures.

## Requirements
To work on this project, it is necessary to have Python version 3.9 or newer installed, along with all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the SVIRO dataset, which is available at the following link: [Sviro](https://sviro.kl.dfki.de/) Dataset.

## Repository
This GitHub repository contains:
- The .py scripts used during the project development, located in the utils folder.
- The results folder, which includes examples of images processed by the network for object identification.
- 
Before working with these files, we highly recommend reading the report we wrote, named ADAS_report_v1.
