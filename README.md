## SVIRO-car-occupancy-recognition-ADAS

# Introduction
The purpose of this univeristy exam was to create a new ADAS or solve limitations of existing ones. We ended up with an idea, increase children's safety as car passengers by training a neural network  able to identify the occupants of the front and rear seat in a car in order to acutate the appropriate safety measures.

# Repository
In this Github repository is possibile to find the .py script we used in the development of the project under the folder 'utils'. The folder 'results' contains examples of images passed through the network for object identification.
